### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marc, and I'm a computational biologist with a background in analyzing large-scale, high-dimensional data derived from biological sources. Though my professional home base is broadly computational biology with an emphasis on comparative genomics, Iâ€™m conversant in a range of disciplines. I have a particular soft spot for probabilistic modeling, including both traditional and machine learning flavors. I also occasionally build stand-alone computational tools and write about data science.

I've worked on a variety projects over the years, but I'm especially proud of the following two:
- [IDR_evolution](https://github.com/marcsingleton/IDR_evolution2023): Evolutionary analyses of protein sequences in *Drosophila* genomes
- [Homomorph](https://github.com/marcsingleton/homomorph): A numerically stable implementation of essential HMM algorithms with tutorials on training methods

To see what I've been thinking about lately, check out my [blog](https://marcsingleton.github.io/) where I write on topics related to coding, statistics, and biology.
